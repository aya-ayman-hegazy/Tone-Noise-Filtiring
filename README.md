# Tone-Noise-Filtiring
  This Python project aims to create a ringtone of desired frequencies and add noise to it. The project then employs Laplace transform techniques to filter out the noise and restore the original sound.

The project begins by generating a sine wave of the desired frequency using the Python library NumPy. The user can specify the frequency and duration of the tone, as well as the type and level of noise to be added.

Once the ringtone is generated and the noise is added, the project uses Laplace transform techniques to filter out the noise from the signal. This involves transforming the signal into the Laplace domain, applying a transfer function to remove the noise, and then transforming the signal back into the time domain using inverse Laplace transform.

The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows the user to visualize the original signal and the filtered signal, as well as the noise power spectrum and the transfer function used for filtering.
Overall, this project demonstrates the use of signal processing techniques in Python to create and filter audio signals, and can be used as a starting point for further exploration and experimentation in this field.
